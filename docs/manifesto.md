# **Born to Build: A Manifesto for Onchain Builders**

Say gm to the onchain builders.

The ones shipping a better tomorrow, not simply hoping for it.

They build their own path, breaking free from the corporate mold. They question the norms, ignore conventions, and reimagine the future.

Where others see obstacles, they see opportunity.

They are driven by curiosity, not corner offices. They don't seek power, but to empower. They are born to build, not to be bossed around.

They keep building, even if their work goes unnoticed. They keep showing up, even when the market is down. They keep trying, even when others quit.

While others applaud the loudest voices, we celebrate the unsung heroes of the blockchain.

The world might underestimate them. Mock their ideals and laugh at their dreams. But they keep building. Not for quick gains, but driven by a need for lasting change.

This is a testament to their courage, resilience, and creativity. We stand beside them, following their vision, supporting their work. You can't quantify their impact in market cap alone, because their legacy is being written in immutable code.

They are the onchain builders. The visionaries of a new era, the rebels shaping the new internet.

And while some dismiss them as naive, we know they are the most undervalued talent today. They are born to build, and thatâ€™s why they are changing the world.
