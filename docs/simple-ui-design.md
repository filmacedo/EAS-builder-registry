# Builder Registry UI Guidelines - Simplified

## Core Aesthetic

Aim for a clean, minimalist design with strong typography and lots of whitespace. Let the monospace headings establish the technical character while maintaining an elegant, sophisticated feel.

## Colors

Primary: Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF)
Secondary: Light grays for backgrounds and borders
Light: #FAFAFA
Medium: #EEEEEE
Dark: #808080

## Typography

- **Headings**: Monospace font, medium weight (not too heavy)
- **Body**: Light-weight sans-serif (300 weight if possible)
- **Technical data**: Monospace (addresses, code, etc.)

Keep text clean and well-spaced. Experiment with slightly lighter weights for body text to enhance sophistication.

## Components

### Navigation & Tabs

Simple black/white contrast. Active state uses black fill, inactive uses outline or gray. Avoid underlines for a cleaner look.

### Cards & Statistics

Simple white cards with minimal shadows or borders. Focus on the content hierarchy with clear, large numbers for statistics.

### Tables

Clean lines, consistent spacing. Avoid zebra striping for a cleaner look. Use hover states instead. Right-align numbers, left-align text.

### Buttons

- **Primary**: Black background, white text
- **Secondary**: White background, black border, black text

### Search & Filters

Keep simple and unobtrusive. Use consistent styling with other form elements.

## Interactions

- Subtle hover states (opacity or background changes)
- Quick, smooth transitions (150-200ms)
- Minimal but meaningful animations

## Implementation Notes

- Use shadcn components as your foundation
- Feel free to adjust weights, spacings, and transitions to achieve the right feel
- Focus on typography and whitespace as your primary design elements
- Aim for pixel-perfect implementation where possible

Trust your design instincts while maintaining the clean, technical aesthetic established in the mockups.
